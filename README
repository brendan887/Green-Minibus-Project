## Minibus Identification ML Project

This project involves data collection + processing, and designing training CNNs to classify if the minibus I took to school is present in an image.

Outcomes: Learned the end-to-end process of building ML models, exercised skills in Keras, empirically tested the efficacy of different activation functions, and deployed to a Raspberry Pi to notify me when the minibus passed!
